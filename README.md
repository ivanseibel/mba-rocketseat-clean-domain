# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Study Project

This repository is part of the **MBA Full-Stack Program by Rocketseat**, focused on applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles in software development. The project explores key DDD concepts, architectural patterns, and best practices for building scalable, maintainable applications.

## üìñ Topics Covered

Throughout this project, the following concepts and patterns were studied and applied:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Fundamentals**
- Understanding the importance of a **Ubiquitous Language** for aligning domain experts and developers.
- The role of **Domain Experts** in defining business logic.
- The distinction between **Entities** and **Value Objects** in modeling the domain.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Architectural Principles**
- Implementing **Clean Architecture** to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability.
- Structuring the domain using **Aggregates** and **Aggregate Roots** to maintain data consistency.
- Using **Repositories** as an abstraction layer between the domain and data persistence.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Business Logic and Events**
- **Domain Events** as a way to decouple business logic and notify different parts of the system.
- The role of **Subscribers** in reacting to domain events asynchronously.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Error Handling Strategies**
- **Functional Error Handling**, using `Either`, `Left`, and `Right` to distinguish between failures and successful operations.
- The use of **Watched Lists** to track changes in collections and optimize data persistence.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Subdomain Separation & Communication**
- Structuring applications by separating **Bounded Contexts** for better modularity.
- Ensuring communication between subdomains, even in a monolithic architecture.
- The benefits of designing subdomains for **independent deployment** and scalability.

## üîß Technologies Used
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment.
- **Clean Architecture** principles to structure the codebase.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways
This study project reinforced the importance of **domain modeling**, **separation of concerns**, and **scalable software design**. The knowledge acquired will be instrumental in future full-stack development projects.

## üìå Future Improvements
- Implementing **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** to optimize read and write operations.
- Exploring **Event Sourcing** for better event-driven architectures.
- Adding more real-world use cases to strengthen the practical understanding of DDD.
